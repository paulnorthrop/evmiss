\title{evmiss: Extreme Value Analyses with Missing Data}
\description{
Performs likelihood-based extreme value inferences with
adjustment for the presence of missing values. A Generalised Extreme Value
(GEV) distribution is fitted to block maxima using maximum likelihood
estimation, with the GEV location and scale parameters reflecting the
numbers of non-missing raw values in each block. A Bayesian version is also
provided. For the purposes of comparison, there are options to make no
adjustment for missing values or to discard any block maximum for which
greater than a percentage of the underlying raw values are missing.

The \code{evmiss} package was created to accompany the research
paper Simpson, E. S. and Northrop, P. J. (2025) Accounting for missing data
when modelling block maxima.
}
\details{
The main functions are
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{gev_mle}}: maximum likelihood inference for block maxima based on a GEV
distributon, with \code{\link[=evmiss_methods]{S3 methods}} including \code{confint}.
\item \code{\link{gev_bayes}}: Bayesian inference for block maxima based on a GEV
distributon.
}

For objects returned by \code{gev_mle}, inferences about return levels are
performed by \code{\link{gev_return}}, with with \code{\link[=return_level_methods]{S3 methods}}
including \code{confint}.

The function \code{\link{gev_influence}} quantifies the influence that individual
extreme (small or large) block maxima have on the maximum likelihood
estimators of GEV parameters.

The following example datasets are provided.
\itemize{
\item \code{\link{BloomsburyOzoneMaxima}}: Annual maxima ozone levels at Bloomsbury,
London, UK, 1992-2024.
\item \code{\link{PlymouthOzoneMaxima}}: Annual maxima ozone levels at Plymouth, Devon,
UK, 1998-2024.
\item \code{\link{BrestSurgeMaxima}}: Annual maxima surge heights at Brest, France,
1846-2007.
