Description: Performs likelihood-based extreme value inferences with 
    adjustment for the presence of missing values. A Generalised Extreme Value
    distribution is fitted to block maxima using maximum likelihood estimation, 
    with the location and scale parameters reflecting the numbers of 
    non-missing raw values in each block. A Bayesian version is also provided. 
    For the purposes of comparison, there are options to make no adjustment for 
    missing values or to discard any block maximum for which greater than a 
    percentage of the underlying raw values are missing. Example datasets 
    containing missing values are provided.
